        <div class="panel-body">The modern manufacturing industry is investing in new technologies such as 
        the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud computing and cyber security to cope with 
        system complexity, increase information visibility, improve production performance, and gain 
        competitive advantage in the global market. These advances are rapidly enabling a new generation of 
        smart manufacturing that “enable all information about the manufacturing process to be available 
        whenever it is needed, wherever it is needed, and in an easily comprehensible form across the enterprise 
        and among interconnected enterprises”. Smart manufacturing goes beyond the automation of manufacturing 
        shop floors but rather depends on data-driven innovations to realize high levels of autonomy and 
        optimization of manufacturing enterprises. This webinar will review the Internet of Things (IoT) 
        for smart manufacturing that help you:<br> - Understand the evolution of IoT technology and its applications 
        in the manufacturing domain <br> - Develop the strategy to implement IoT technology for smart manufacturing <br> - 
        Understand the technology of cloud computing and fog computing for IoT data analytics <br> - 
        Realize full potentials of big data through new analytical methods and tools for smarter manufacturing. <br><br>

			<o:p><strong>Abstract:</strong></o:p> Cardiac electrical activities are 
  varying in both space and time. Human heart consists of a fractal network of 
  muscle cells, Purkinje fibers, arteries and veins. Whole-heart modeling of 
  electrical wave conduction and propagation involves a greater level of 
  complexity. Our previous work developed a computer model of the anatomically 
  realistic heart and simulated the electrical conduction with the use of 
  cellular automata and parallel computing. However, simplistic assumptions and 
  rules limit its ability to provide an accurate approximation of real-world 
  dynamics on the complex heart surface, due to sensitive dependence of 
  nonlinear dynamical systems on initial conditions. In this paper, we propose 
  new reaction-diffusion methods and pattern recognition tools to simulate and 
  model spatiotemporal dynamics of electrical wave conduction and propagation on 
  the complex heart surface, which include (i) whole heart model; (ii) 2D 
  isometric graphing of 3D heart geometry; (iii) reaction diffusion modeling of 
  electrical waves in 2D graph, and (iv) spatiotemporal pattern recognition. 
  Experimental results show that the proposed numerical solution has strong 
  potentials to model the space-time dynamics of electrical wave conduction in 
  the whole heart, thereby achieving a better understanding of disease-altered 
  cardiac mechanisms.</o:p></p>

			<o:p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nonlinear dynamics arise whenever multifarious 
  entities of a system cooperate, compete, or interfere. Effective monitoring 
  and control of nonlinear dynamics will increase system quality and integrity, 
  thereby leading to significant economic and societal impacts. In order to cope 
  with system complexity and increase information visibility, modern industries 
  are investing in a variety of sensor networks and dedicated data centers. 
  Real-time sensing gives rise to “big data”. Realizing the full potential of 
  “big data” for advanced quality control requires fundamentally new 
  methodologies to harness and exploit complexity. This talk will present novel 
  nonlinear methodologies that mine dynamic recurrences from in-process big data 
  for real-time system informatics, monitoring, and control. Recurrence (i.e., 
  approximate repetitions of a certain event) is one of the most common 
  phenomena in natural and engineering systems. For examples, the human heart is 
  near-periodically beating to maintain vital living organs. Stamping machines 
  are cyclically forming sheet metals during production. Process monitoring of 
  dynamic transitions in complex systems (e.g., disease conditions or 
  manufacturing quality) is more concerned about aperiodic recurrences and 
  heterogeneous recurrence variations. However, little has been done to 
  investigate heterogeneous recurrence variations and link with the objectives 
  of process monitoring and anomaly detection. This talk will present the state 
  of art in nonlinear recurrence analysis and a new heterogeneous recurrence 
  methodology for monitoring and control of nonlinear stochastic processes. 
  Specifically, the developed methodologies will be demonstrated in both 
  manufacturing and healthcare applications. The proposed methodology is 
  generally applicable to a variety of complex systems exhibiting nonlinear 
  dynamics, e.g., precision machining, sleep apnea, aging study, 
  nanomanufacturing, biomanufacturing. In the end, future research directions 
  will be discussed.<o:p><o:p><span id="yui_3_14_1_1_1510023391136_655" data-reactid="61">&nbsp;

  networks and dedicated data centers to increase information visibility. 
  Advanced sensing captures a wealth of information on the condition and status 
  of a product, process or a system. As a result, we are facing spatially and 
  temporally data-rich environments. The next major challenge is in harnessing 
  the big data to bring substantial improvements to the design and operations, 
  particular in quality and integrity assurance, of complex systems. This talk 
  will present an integral approach of physics-based modeling and sensor-based 
  informatics to advance knowledge discovery and innovation in complex systems. 
  First, I will describe a new physical-statistical modeling approach for 
  efficient and effective computer experiments and optimization of cardiac 
  models. Computer modeling and experiments provide physiologists and 
  cardiologists an indispensable tool to characterize and model cardiac 
  functions in health and in disease, as well as to optimize medical decision 
  making. In this study, an easy-to-evaluate surrogate model is developed for 
  faster approximation and calibration of cardiac models to investigate 
  glycosylation-altered kinetics of Na+ ion channels and the causal effects on 
  cardiac cells. Second, I will talk about a new approach of sparse particle 
  filtering for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of big data in distributed 
  sensor networks. Distributed sensing gives rise to spatially-temporally big 
  data. Realizing the full potentials of distributed sensing calls for 
  space-time data fusion in the dynamically-evolving physical environment. In 
  this study, we developed a sparse particle filtering model to recursively 
  estimate and update latent state variables for predicting nonlinear stochastic 
  dynamics and modeling close interactions between spatial and temporal 
  processes in distributed sensor networks. In the end, future research 
  directions will be discussed.</span></p>

  advancement of distributed sensing and imaging technology brings the 
  proliferation of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data, i.e., y(s; t) and x(s;

  systems. For example, infrared cameras are commonly used to capture dynamic 
  thermal images of 3D parts in additive manufacturing. The temperature 
  distribution within parts enables engineers to investigate how process 
  conditions impact the strength, residual stress and microstructures of 
  fabricated products. The ECG sensor network is placed on the body surface to 
  acquire the distribution of electric potentials y(s; t), also named body 
  surface potential mapping (BSPM). Medical scientists call for the estimation 
  of electric potentials x(s; t) on the heart surface from BSPM y(s; t) so as to 
  investigate cardiac pathological activities (e.g., tissue damages in the 
  heart). However, spatiotemporally varying data and complex geometries (e.g.,

			<o:p><strong>Abstract: </strong></o:p>
  Rapid advancement of sensing and information technology brings the big data, 
  which presents a gold mine of the 21st century to advance knowledge discovery. 
  However, big data also brings significant challenges for data-driven decision 
  making. In particular, it is common that a large number of variables (or 
  predictors, features) underlie the big data. Complex interdependence 
  structures among variables challenge the traditional framework of predictive 
  modeling. This paper presents a new methodology of self-organizing network for 
  variable clustering and predictive modeling. Specifically, we developed a new 
  approach, namely nonlinear coupling analysis to measure nonlinear 
  interdependence structures among variables. Further, all the variables are 
  embedded as nodes in a complex network. Nonlinear-coupling forces move these 
  nodes to derive a self-organizing topology of network. As such, variables are 
  clustered as sub-network communities in the space. Experimental results 
  demonstrated that the proposed method not only outperforms traditional 
  variable clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering and oblique 
  principal component analysis, but also effectively identify interdependent 
  structures among variables and further improves the performance of predictive 
  modeling. The proposed new methodology of self-organizing variable clustering 
  is generally applicable for data-driven decision making in many disciplines 
  that involve a large number of highly-redundant variables. </o:p>

        <div class="panel-body"> <strong>Abstract</strong>: Wireless sensor network has emerged as a key technology for monitoring space-time dynamics of complex systems, 
        e.g., environmental sensor network, battlefield surveillance network, and body area sensor network. However, sensor failures are not uncommon 
        in traditional sensing systems. As such, we propose the design of stochastic sensor networks to allow a subset of sensors at varying locations 
        within the network to transmit dynamic information intermittently. Realizing the full potential of stochastic sensor network hinges on the 
        development of novel information-processing algorithms to support the design and exploit the uncertain information for decision making. 
        This paper presents a new approach of sparse particle filtering to model spatiotemporal dynamics of big data in the stochastic sensor network. 
        Notably, we developed a sparse kernel-weighted regression model to achieve a parsimonious representation of spatial patterns. 
        Further, the parameters of spatial model are transformed into a reduced-dimension space, and thereby sequentially updated with the 
        recursive Bayesian estimation when new sensor observations are available over time. Therefore, spatial and temporal processes 
        closely interact with each other. Experimental results on real-world data and different scenarios of stochastic sensor networks 
        (i.e., spatially, temporally, and spatiotemporally dynamic networks) demonstrated the effectiveness of sparse particle filtering to 
        support the stochastic design and harness the uncertain information for modeling space-time dynamics of complex systems.

        <div class="panel-body"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Additive manufacturing (AM) provides a greater level of flexibility to produce a 3D part 
        with complex geometries directly from the design. However, the widespread application of AM is currently hampered by technical challenges 
        in process repeatability and quality control. To  enhance the in-process information visibility, advanced sensing is increasingly invested 
        for real-time AM process monitoring. The proliferation of in-situ sensing data calls for the development of analytical methods for the 
        extraction of features sensitive to layerwise defects, and the exploitation of pertinent knowledge about defects for in-process quality 
        control of AM builds. As a result, there are increasing interests and rapid development of sensor-based models for the characterization 
        and estimation of layerwise defects in the past few years. However, very little has been done to go from sensor-based modeling of defects 
        to the suggestion of in-situ corrective actions for quality control of AM builds. In this talk, we present a new sequential decision-making 
        framework for in-situ control of AM processes through the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which jointly considers the 
        conflicting objectives of both total cost (i.e., energy or time) and build quality. Experimental results show that the CMDP formulation 
        provides an effective policy for executing corrective actions to repair and counteract incipient defects in AM before completion of the build.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: Advanced manufacturing is moving towards a new paradigm of ‘low-volume-high-mix’ production. There is an urgent need to develop effective representations of real-world 3D objects and further enable the matching and retrieval of engineering designs. This paper presents a new self-organizing network representation of 3D objects. Each voxel of the 3D object is a node in a network, and the edge is dependent on node closeness in space. Then, the network is self-organized by balancing attractive and repulsive forces between the nodes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of network representation by reassembling the geometry of 3D objects.<br>

<strong>Abstract</strong>: Physics-based principles (e.g., heat transfer, bioelectromagnetism theorems) generally help predict complex dynamics in manufacturing and healthcare systems. For example, mechanical engineers leverage infrared cameras and heat-transfer physics to predict thermal distribution within 3D builds in additive manufacturing. Medical scientists use bioelectromagnetism physics to predict heart-surface electric potentials and investigate cardiac pathological activities (e.g., tissue damages in the heart).  However, physics-based principles do not account for real-world uncertainties, thereby often generating predictions that have discrepancies from sensor observations. Such uncertainties may be introduced by simplified physical assumptions, geometric variations, measurement noises, and other extraneous factors.  This talk will present a novel physics-driven spatiotemporal regularization (STRE) method for high-dimensional predictive modeling in complex manufacturing and healthcare systems. This model not only captures the physics-based interrelationship between time-varying explanatory and response variables that are distributed in the space, but also addresses the spatial and temporal regularizations to improve the prediction performance. <br>

	<strong>Abstract:</strong> The Internet of Things (IoT) has propelled the evolution of medical sensing technologies to greater heights. Thus, traditional health systems have been transformed into new data-rich environments. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop new analytical methods and tools towards a new paradigm of digital medicine. However, big data arising from healthcare system also pose a significant challenge for efficient and effective sensor-based information processing and medical decision making. In this talk, we will present novel methods and tools about in-silico modeling, experiments and analytics for medical discoveries and healthcare innovations. Specifically, we will demonstrate digital health networks, biophysics-driven models, sensor-based models, statistical models, as well as optimization models to improve the understanding of disease-altered physiological dynamics. Further, treatment plans can be optimized, and life-saving interventions can be delivered in a timely manner. Finally, new pharmaceutical approaches can be designed by imposing genetical and molecular changes that counterbalance the dysfunction due to disease progressions. The new generation of digital medicine is strongly promised to improve the health of our society in the US and in the world.     <br>
